// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step of process ,and it is used to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements."
const design = "This is the third step of process. This models the way a software application will work"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step of process , and it process the configuring of the software for certain conditions of use, as well as training customers to work with the product"
const testingAndIntergration = "This is the fifth step of processt . It is critical to test an application before making it available to users/customer "
const maintain = "This is the sixth step of process. In this phase, bugs are discovered that were not found during testing."
